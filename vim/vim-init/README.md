# vim-init
This project is modified based on [skywind3000/vim-init](https://github.com/skywind3000/vim-init). [skywind3000/vim-init](https://github.com/skywind3000/vim-init) is a lightweight vim configuration framework, which is well organized and can be easily extended.

* Colors and plugins in original project are removed.
* Configurations work well with neovim. I will make them compatible with vim as much as I can.
